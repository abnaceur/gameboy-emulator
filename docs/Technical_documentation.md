### What is an emulator?

To understand our project, it is necessary to learn what an emulator is and how it works.
An emulator is a computer or program that simulates or imitates another computer or program. 
In our project, we aim to make it possible to run a Gameboy or Gameboy Color ROM game on a computer. 
To realize that, we had to build a similar virtual architecture as the original Gameboy.
